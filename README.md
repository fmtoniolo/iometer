## Source code for Google Apps Script integration with Spreadsheets.

A simple source code for google spreadsheets to search for World of Warcraft characters, using the char's name as input, and returning information about it's class, last active spec, item level equiped, covenant, renown, M+ score (for the current season), and the current expansion raids progressions as well.

All Info sources comes from the Raider.io API.

Note: this source code, for now, works only for US-Azralon server (you can change to the server you need in the code, but only one at a time). If you search for a char name from other server, it will show the Azralon's character, or an error (if the name doesn't exists).
Contributions for a multi-server update are welcome!
